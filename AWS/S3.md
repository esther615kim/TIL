`#75 Overview`
- Amazon S3 is one of the main building blocks of AWS
- It's advertised as `infinitely scaling` storage

- Many websites use Amazon S3 as a backbone
- Many AWS services uses Amazon S3 as an integration as well

- Amazon S3 allows ppl to store object(files) in "buckets" `directories`
- Buckets must have a globally unique name - across all regions all accounts
- Buckets are defined at the region level
- S3 is not a global service but buckets are created in a region
- `Naming convention`
> no uppercase, no underscore, 3-63 characters long, not an IP and must start with lowercase letter or number

#### S3 Use cases
- backup and storage
- Disaster Recovery
- Archive
- Hybrid Cloud sotrage
- Application hosting
- Media hosting
and more


### Objects
- Objects (or files) have a `key`
- `key` is the FULL path! `s3://my-bucket/my_file.txt`
- `key` is composed of prefix + object name `s3://my-bucket/my_folder/another_folder/my_file.text`
- no concept of "directories" within buckets
- JUST keys with very long names that contains `slashes`

- Max object sieze is 5TB(5000GB)
- if uploading more than 5GB, must use "multi-part upload"
- Metadata(list of text key / value pairs)
- Tags( Unicode key/value pair) -useful for security / lifecycle
- Version ID (if versioning is enabled)
