### Refactoring
- It is the process of changing the desing of your cod without changing its behaviour.
- What it does stays the same, but how it does it changes.
- Refactoring is not rewriting. Nor is it any arbitrary change. It is a careful and step-by-step approach to incrementally improving the design of your code.
- Refactoring is reversible: no one right answer or one right direction.
